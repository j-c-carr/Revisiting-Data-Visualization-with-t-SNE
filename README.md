# Revisiting Data Visualization with t-SNE: A Reproduction Study

This code requires `python 3.7` and the python packages outlined in `requirements.txt`. The details and plots to produce our experiments are contained in three jupyter notebooks:
* `experiments.ipynb` contains the code used to reproduce the original paper's results, as well as our perplexity and generalization error experiments.
* `pca_analysis.ipynb` contains the code for the PCA analysis ablation study.
* `crowding_problem.ipynb` contains the code for the Crowding problem ablation study.
